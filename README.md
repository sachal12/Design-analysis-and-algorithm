Accept a One dimensional array using random number generator. The array may be in the range of [0,1,2] [Only three numbers are permitted] Scan the array and print "X" if number "0" is more than number of "1" and "2". Print "Y" if number of "1" are more than "0" and "2" Print "Z" if number of "2" are more than "0" and "1" Expected complexity O(log n)
